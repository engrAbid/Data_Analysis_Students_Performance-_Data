# Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  

Handling Missing Values  
One of the first challenges was dealing with missing or incomplete data. Empty cells and errors were scattered throughout the dataset, which could distort analysis results. To address this:  
I used Excel tools to locate blank cells efficiently.  
Missing values in critical columns were either filled with default values or estimated based on available data.  
Functions helped replace errors with meaningful placeholders.  

Correcting Spelling and Formatting Errors  
Inconsistent data entry was another major issue. For example:  
Gender entries varied between different formats which were standardized.  
Subject names had typos, which were corrected using Find and Replace.  
Extra spaces were removed, while name formatting was corrected.  

Standardizing Data Formats  
To maintain consistency:  
Dates were formatted uniformly.  
Numeric grades were adjusted to two decimal places.  
Combined fields were split into separate columns.  


# Step 2: Data Validation and Quality Checks  

Removing Duplicate Entries  
Duplicate records can lead to incorrect analysis.
Applied Remove Duplicates function.  
Used formulas to verify unique entries.  

Detecting and Correcting Outliers  
Some data points were unrealistic. To fix this:  
Conditional Formatting highlighted extreme values.  
Statistical functions helped identify anomalies.  

Formula-Based Calculations  
To enhance the datasets analytical value:  
Aggregate scores were computed.  
Performance categories were assigned using logical statements.  
# Step 3: Structuring and Exporting Cleaned Data  

Sorting and Filtering for Better Readability  
Data was sorted by key fields for easier navigation.  
Filters enabled quick analysis of specific groups.  

Creating Summary Tables  
To extract insights:  
Average performance by different categories was analyzed.  
Class-wise performance ratios were calculated.  
Final Export and Documentation  
The cleaned dataset was saved with a new filename.  
A documentation sheet recorded all modifications.  

# Conclusion  
Through systematic cleaning and validation, the dataset is now error-free, consistent, and ready for advanced analysis. This process ensured complete data, uniform formatting, and accurate calculations for reliable insights.  

Next Steps  
Visualizations could be created to represent trends.  
Statistical analysis could study performance relationships.  
Automation could streamline future data cleaning.
